Add any source files in this directory and specify them to be
sourced in the .rnl file.

supervisorBatch.R:   The script controlling the supervisor session.
You should not need to change this and keep the name the same if you do. 

doTaskTest.R:  Sample doTask function.
Note that it takes only one argument, the task ID number but of course can
use all the objects in the worker session that have been broadcast to it from the supervisor. 

In the .rnl  script reassign the function with the name doTask.
E.g. in this case
doTask <- doTaskTest
