Add any source files in this directory and specify them to be sourced
in the .rnl file.

HPC4StatsSupervisor.R: The script controlling the supervisor session.
You should not need to change this for most projects. See the
batch/supervisorBatch.R to see how this is sourced in a batch job.

doTaskTest.R: Sample doTask function.  Note that it takes only one
argument, the task ID number but of course can use all the objects in
the worker session that have been broadcast to it from the supervisor.

Typically one would source a doTask type function into the supervisor
session and then reassign it to have the name doTask this avoids many
function in a source directory all called doTask.  E.g. in this case

doTask <- doTaskTest

See the template.rnl example for more details.
