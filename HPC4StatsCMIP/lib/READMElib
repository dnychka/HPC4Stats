This directory is a good place to put R packages that are built
locally.  To install a package from the HPC4Stats home directory to
lib
 
R CMD INSTALL --library=lib package.tar.gz

Here package.tar.gz is the source code "tar ball" that is either
obtained from CRAN or another source.

Loading of packages is controlled by the library list created in the
.rnl file and managed in the supervisorBatch.R script
